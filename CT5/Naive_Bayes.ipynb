Bayesâ€™ theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of a data point belonging to a given class, given our prior knowledge. It is defined as\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbb P (class|data) = \\frac{\\mathbb P (data|class) \\ \\mathbb P (class)}{\\mathbb P (data)} ,\n","$$\n","\n","where $\\mathbb P (class | data)$ is the probability over the potential classes given the provided data. The different probabilities $\\mathbb P$ you see in the equations above are commonly called prior, likelihood, evidence, and posterior as follows.\n","\n","$$\n","\\overbrace{\\mathbb P (class|data)}^{\\text{posterior}} = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\mathbb P (data|class)}^{\\text{likelihood}} \\ \\overbrace{\\mathbb P (class)}^{\\text{prior}}}{\\underbrace{\\mathbb P (data)}_{\\text{evidence}}}\n","$$\n","\n","The algorithm is 'naive', because of its assumption that features of data are independent given the class label.
