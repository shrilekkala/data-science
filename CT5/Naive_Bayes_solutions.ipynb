Bayesâ€™ theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of a data point belonging to a given class, given our prior knowledge. It is defined as\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbb P (class|data) = \\frac{\\mathbb P (data|class) \\ \\mathbb P (class)}{\\mathbb P (data)} ,\n","$$\n","\n","where $\\mathbb P (class | data)$ is the probability over the potential classes given the provided data. The different probabilities $\\mathbb P$ you see in the equations above are commonly called prior, likelihood, evidence, and posterior as follows.\n","\n","$$\n","\\overbrace{\\mathbb P (class|data)}^{\\text{posterior}} = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\mathbb P (data|class)}^{\\text{likelihood}} \\ \\overbrace{\\mathbb P (class)}^{\\text{prior}}}{\\underbrace{\\mathbb P (data)}_{\\text{evidence}}}\n","$$\n","\n","The algorithm is 'naive', because of its assumption that features of data are independent given the class label. Let us call the data features $x_1, \\dots, x_i, \\dots, x_n$ and the class label $y$, and rewrite Bayes theorem in these terms:\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbb P (y|x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\frac{\\mathbb P (x_1, \\dots, x_n|y) * \\mathbb P (y)}{\\mathbb P (x_1, \\dots, x_n)} \\, . \n","$$\n","\n","Then, the naive assumption of conditional independence between any two features given the class label can be expressed as\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbb P(x_i | y, x_1, \\dots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \\dots, x_n) = \\mathbb P (x_i | y) \\, .\n","$$\n","\n","For all $i$, we can simply Bayes' theorem to:\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbb P (y | x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\frac{\\mathbb P (y) \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb P(x_i | y)}{\\mathbb P (x_1, \\dots, x_n)} \\, .\n","$$\n","\n","Since $\\mathbb P (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is the constant input, we can define the following proportional relationship\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbb P (y|x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\propto \\mathbb P (y) \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb P(x_i | y) \\, ,\n","$$\n","\n","and can use it to classify any data point as\n","\n","$$\n","\\hat y = \\underset{y}{\\text{arg max}} \\ \\mathbb P (y) \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb P(x_i | y) \\, .\n","$$\n","\n","To learn how this algorithm works in practice, we define a simple data set of emails being either spam or not (adopted from Chapter 3.5, Exercise 3.22 in Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Murphy). _Note that Naive Bayes can indeed be used for multiclass classification, however we use it here as a binary classifier._ \n","\n","We will work with the packages numpy and pandas, but also make our lives a bit easier with sklearn's implemented feature extractor to count words and its validation module to check whether data arrives in the format we need it."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8r_Xo0HklZFx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606215320627,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":1710,"user":{"displayName":"Felix
