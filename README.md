# Data Science Coursework (Imperial College London)

This repository contains coursework and projects completed during my **BSc Mathematics at Imperial College London**, focused on applied data science and machine learning concepts.

## Highlight Project: Neural Network Image Classification (CW2)
Implemented and compared:
- **MLP from scratch (NumPy):** forward pass, backpropagation, softmax + cross-entropy, mini-batch training  
- **CNN baseline (TensorFlow/Keras):** convolution + pooling architecture for CIFAR-10

**Results (from notebook runs):**
- MLP (scratch) validation accuracy: ~0.53  
- CNN (Keras) validation accuracy: ~0.72
